This project consists of a library of packages and a main script that can be
run as a pipeline. The pipeline script is designed to run quality control
and custom filtering on Illumina data, perform assembly and identify contigs
of interest based on COG keywords.

The primary application it was designed for is to identify plasmid contigs in
unfinished microbial genomes and producing preliminary assemblies.

STATUS: The code is operational but requires setting up some files and config
parameters manually. This procedure is not yet described in the documentation. 

As of 15 Oct 2011 development is on hold.
